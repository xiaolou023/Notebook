# Simulation仿真法

## Simulation v.s. Optimization

If simulation models are chosen, researchers must be cognizant of the fact that optimal or near-optimal results are not generated. Instead, solutions will be realized with multiple simulation runs generating break-even points or acceptable profits. Simulation must also take account of drawbacks with respect to transparency and reproducibility. While optimization models consist of clearly formulated target functions and constraints, simulation is more dependent on the simulation framework utilized, on the assumptions made and on detailed validation and verification procedures.
