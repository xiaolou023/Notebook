#### Some concepts

1. Any real number can be written as the difference of two nonnegative numbers.
2. The convex combination of point $x$ and $y$ belong to the line segment joining point $x$ and $y$.
3. Linear function (cost function of linear optimization) --- piecewise linear convex function --- general convex function.
4. The maximum of a set of convex functions is convex as well.
5. Polyhedron
   (1)  described by a finite number of linear equality and inequality constraints;
   (2)  described as the intersection of a finite number of halfspaces.
6. The intersection of convex sets is convex as well.
7. Every polyhedron is a convex set.
8. A polyhedron may either extend to infinity or be bounded.
9. Being a basic solution depends on the representation of polyhedron.
10. Being a basic feasible solution is independent of the representation of polyhedron.
11. Degeneracy of basic feasible solutions depends on the representation of polyhedron.
12. Polyhedron in standard form doesn't contain a line.
13. Every nonempty polyhedron and every nonempty polyhedron in standard form has at least one basic feasible solution.
