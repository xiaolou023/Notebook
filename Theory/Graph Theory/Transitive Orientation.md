# Transitive Orientation

The *transitive orientation* problem is the problem of assigning a direction to each edge of a graph so that the resulting digraph is transitive. 

An undirected graph has a transitive orientation if its edges can be oriented in such a way that if $(x, y)$ and $(y, z)$ are two edges in the resulting directed graph, there also exists an edge $(x, z)$ in the resulting directed graph.
