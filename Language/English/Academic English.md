1. in both **academic research** and **practical context**
2. are actively **investigating** the potentials of drones in delivery applications
3. have a significant impact on the performance of xx in finding an optimal solution to small-scale instances.
4. provide a brief overview of the existing academic literature that is related to the applications of drone in last-mile delivery.
5. Finally we **draw a conclusion on** this work and on future research implications.
6. to assess the performance of our proposed heuristics on various problem instances
7. However, this problem has been given much less attention in the literature despite its wide range of practical applications. 
8. **As it concerns** reservation, new car sharing systems offer
users open-ended reservation and/or instant access.
9. The high critical threshold **is upper limited by** the space available in the station.
10. **On a final note**, we wish to highlight the topic of demand
estimation.
