**Some concepts**

1. **Guillotine cutting**, which is also called edge-to-edge cutting, is a common method for cutting rectangular forms, in which the cutting edge starts on one side and continues to the opposite side.

   The guillotine cut means a horizontal or a vertical cut on a (sub)rectangle being cut from one edge of the (sub)rectangle to the opposite edge, parallel to the two remaining edges.
   
2. **Orientation constraints**, the rotations of the items are limited.

3. A pattern is **guillotine-cuttable** if it satisfies a least one of the following constraints.

   - The pattern contains at most three rectangles.
   - There exists an $x$ with $(0<x<W)$ so that we can separate the set of rectangles into two nonempty sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ such that $x_i + w_i \leq x, \forall i \in S_1$ and $x_i \geq x, \forall i \in S_2$ and both sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ are guillotine-cuttable.
   - A symmetric property holds for the $y$ coordinates.
