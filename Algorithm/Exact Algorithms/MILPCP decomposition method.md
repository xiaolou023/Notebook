> Jain, V., & Grossmann, I. E. (2001). Algorithms for Hybrid MILP/CP Models for a Class of Optimization Problems. INFORMS Journal on Computing, 13(4), 258â€“276. https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.13.4.258.9733

The idea is based on `benders' decomposition`. In this paper, the master problem is formulated as a MILP model, and the slave problem is formulated as a CP model.
